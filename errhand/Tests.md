# Tests used for Error Handling

To run the Go tests for the project, use the go test command followed by the package path of the tests you want to run.
Here's how to run the tests for the project:

- Open the terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory containing the Go project files.
- Run the following command to run all tests the your project:

```
go test ./...
```

This command tells Go to run all tests in the current directory and its subdirectories (./...)
If there are multiple packages within the project, this command will run tests for all of them.

Make sure you are in the root directory of the Go project where the Go files and test files are located.

After running the go test command, Go will execute the test functions and display the test results in the terminal.
